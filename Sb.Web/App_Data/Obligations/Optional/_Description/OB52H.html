<p>As a hobby, you <strong>don’t need an ABN for government purposes.</strong> If you sell goods or services to businesses, you can use a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Statement-by-a-supplier-not-quoting-an-ABN/">statement by a supplier form</a> to avoid the business withholding an amount from the payment to you for not having an ABN. The statement lets the business know that you are selling the goods or service for your hobby.</p>
