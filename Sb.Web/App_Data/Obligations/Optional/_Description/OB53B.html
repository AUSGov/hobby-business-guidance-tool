<p>A business name is a title under which a person, or other legal entity, trades. You must register a business name if you want to trade under a name other than your own.</p>
<p>Before you register a business name, you should check that:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-business-name/before-you-start/business-name-availability/">the business name is available</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://whois.ausregistry.com.au/whois/whois_check.jsp">the domain name is available</a> if you intend to have a website</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/applying-for-a-trade-mark/searching-trade-marks">the name is available as a trade mark.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll need an <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/info/plan-and-start/start-your-business/business-and-company-registration/australian-business-number">Australian Business Number (ABN)</a> before you register your business name and you can apply for both at the same time.</p>
