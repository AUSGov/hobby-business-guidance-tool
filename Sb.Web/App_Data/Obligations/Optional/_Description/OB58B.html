<p>The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a tax on the supply of most goods and services in Australia.</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> register for GST if:</p>

<ul>
    <li>your business has a GST turnover of $75,000 or more in a twelve-month period</li>
    <li>your non-profit organisation has a turnover of $150,000 per year or more</li>
    <li>you provide taxi travel for passengers in exchange for a fare as part of your business, regardless of your GST turnover. This rule applies to both taxi owner drivers and people who rent a taxi.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not reach this level of turnover, registration is <strong>optional</strong> unless you’re required to be registered as outlined above.</p>

<p>As a business owner, it's your responsibility to register for GST if your turnover exceeds or is likely to exceed the $75,000 threshold. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) advises that you should register for GST if you've just started a new business and expect it to earn $75,000 or more in its first year of operation.</p>

<p>The calculation of turnover for GST generally includes the goods and services you supply, but doesn’t include any capital assets you may have disposed of, or input taxed supplies you made e.g. share trading, residential rents.</p>
