<p>Pay as You Go (PAYG) instalments is a system for making regular payments towards your expected tax bill to save you from a large tax bill at the end of the year.</p>

<p>You can register for PAYG voluntarily, however the ATO will let you know when you need to pay by instalments based on your income tax return.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you might choose to put money away regularly in a bank account to cover a possible tax bill.</p>
