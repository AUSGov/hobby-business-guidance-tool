<p>If you want to be in business, consider registering for an ABN.</p>

<p>You’ll <strong>need</strong> an Australian Business Number (ABN) for government purposes if you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>are running a business and want to register for GST</li>
    <li>
        need to register for Pay as You Go (PAYG) either because:
        <ul>
            <li>you have business income and need to make payments towards your expected tax bill (PAYG instalments), or</li>
            <li>you employ people and need to withhold tax from their salary and wages (PAYG withholding).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If you already have an ABN, you don’t need to register for a new one. If you’re changing the type of activity you do, you can use your existing ABN. Your ABN stays with you, although you need to <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Registration/Add-or-cancel-a-registration/Cancel-ABN-(cease-business)/">notify the Australian Taxation Office</a> if you stop using it.</p>

<p>If you change your business structure e.g. <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Plan-and-Start/Start-your-business/Business-structure/Change-business-structure/Sole-trader-to-a-company">changing from a sole trader to a company,</a> you’ll need to register a new ABN.</p>

<h4>If you don’t have an ABN</h4>

<p>If you sell goods or services to businesses, they may ask you for an ABN when they pay you. It’s not compulsory to have an ABN. You can use a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Statement-by-a-supplier-not-quoting-an-ABN/">Statement by a supplier form.</a> to avoid the business withholding an amount from the payment to you for not having an ABN. The statement lets the business know that you are selling the goods or services as your hobby.</p>
