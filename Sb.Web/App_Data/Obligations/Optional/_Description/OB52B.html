<p>If you want to be in business, consider registering for an ABN.</p>

<p>You’ll <strong>need</strong> an Australian Business Number (ABN) for government purposes if you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>are running a business and want to register for GST</li>
    <li>need to register for Pay as You Go (PAYG) either because:
        <ul>
            <li>you have business income and need to make payments towards your expected tax bill (PAYG instalments), or</li>
            <li>you employ people and need to withhold tax from their salary and wages (PAYG withholding).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If you already have an ABN, you don’t need to register for a new one. If you’re changing the type of activity you do, you can use your existing ABN. Your ABN stays with you, although you need to <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Registration/Add-or-cancel-a-registration/Cancel-ABN-(cease-business)/">notify the Australian Taxation Office</a> if you stop using it.</p>

<p>If you change your business structure e.g. <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Plan-and-Start/Start-your-business/Business-structure/Change-business-structure/Sole-trader-to-a-company">changing from a sole trader to a company,</a> you’ll need to register a new ABN.</p>

<h4>If you don’t have an ABN</h4>

<p>If you sell goods and services to businesses and don’t have an ABN, you may be able to use a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Statement-by-a-supplier-not-quoting-an-ABN/">Statement by a supplier form.</a> This form is useful to avoid the business withholding an amount from the payment to you for not having an ABN.</p>
