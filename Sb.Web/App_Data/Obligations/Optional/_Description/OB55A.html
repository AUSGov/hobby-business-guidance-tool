<p>Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs and symbols, names and images.</p>
<p>There are four IP rights you can register to legally protect your work and these include a Trade mark, Patent, Design or Plant Breeder’s Right. For example, you may wish to patent your invention or trade mark your logo or brand. It’s important to consider registering your IP early as the application process may take some time.</p>
<p>You do not need to apply for copyright protection as it automatically applies to original work.</p>

<h4>Did you know?</h4>
<p>Registering a business name does not give you exclusive trading rights over that name. You’ll need to register a trade mark to protect your name or brand.</p>
