<p>You’ll need to register a domain name if you want to set up a website for your business. A domain name is your address on the internet and gives you an online identity when setting up for your website e.g. handmade.com.au.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to give your domain provider an Australian Business Number (ABN) if you want to use a 'com.au' or 'net.au' domain name on your website.</p>
