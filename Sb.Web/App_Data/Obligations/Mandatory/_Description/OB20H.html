<p>You <strong>do not</strong> need to declare the amounts you make from your hobby to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). You cannot claim deductions for expenses you incur for your hobby.</p>

<p>If you rely on this tool for tax purposes, the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Gen/Our-commitment-to-you/">ATO’s commitment statement</a> applies to you. Make sure you keep a copy of the outcome you get under the tool.</p>

<p>This tool only applies to money you’re getting from making creative works.  What you need to declare for tax purposes may change if you are getting money from doing other things with your creative work, such as teaching or performing.</p>

    <li>make payments where income is considered, such as for child support.</li>
