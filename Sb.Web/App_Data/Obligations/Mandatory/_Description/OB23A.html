<p>The Australian, state and territory, and local governments are responsible for different licences, permits, registrations and certificates.</p>

<p>You’ll need licences and permits, depending on where and what your activity is e.g. running a market stall and/or selling food. This will help ensure you’re not illegally operating your business.</p>

<p>Search for your specific licences on the <a href="https://ablis.business.gov.au/">Australian Business and Licence Information Service (ABLIS).</a></p>
