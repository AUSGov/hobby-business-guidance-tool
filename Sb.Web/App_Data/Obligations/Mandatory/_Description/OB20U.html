<p>If you’re a <strong>hobby</strong>, you <strong>do not</strong> need to declare the amounts you make from your hobby to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). You cannot claim deductions for expenses you incur for your hobby either.</p>

<p>If you’re in <strong>business</strong>, you <strong>will</strong> need to declare your income to the ATO in your annual return. Check the tax return for guidance on where to declare this income.</p>

<p>You <strong>will</strong> need to report the amounts you earn from your hobby or business if you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>receive certain payments, such as from Centrelink or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA).</li>
    <li>make payments where income is considered, such as for child support.</li>
</ul>
