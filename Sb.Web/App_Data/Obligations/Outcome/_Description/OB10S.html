    We are sorry but based on your answers, it is still unclear if your creative work is a hobby or not.

    At this point in time, all of your answers are similar to someone who is undertaking a hobby, except for your answer that you sell to the public.  Selling to the public can be an indicator of a business activity.  It depends on how often you sell your work and the amount you sell.  If you don’t sell your creative works regularly, or don’t sell very many, you may still be similar to someone undertaking a hobby.

    <h2>Did you know?</h2>
    <p>You can't claim a deduction for any losses from your creative work if it is a hobby.</p>
    <p>It's a myth that there is a dollar threshold to be in a business. Some people can have very expensive hobbies! What matters is whether, as a whole, your activity is commercial with an aim to make a profit. <strong>Once</strong> you're in business, there are dollar thresholds that can affect <strong>your tax obligations</strong>.</p>
